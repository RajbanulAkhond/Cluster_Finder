"""
Utility functions for cluster_finder package.

This module provides common utility functions used throughout the package,
particularly focusing on:
- Statistical analysis of clusters
- Data summarization and reporting
- Error handling and input validation
- Geometric calculations

The functions in this module are designed to work with the data structures
used in the cluster_finder package, particularly the compound and cluster
dictionaries produced by the analysis functions.

import numpy as np

def calculate_centroid(sites, lattice=None):
    """
    Calculate the centroid (geometric center) of a group of sites.
    
    For periodic structures (when lattice is provided), the function handles
    periodic boundary conditions by:
    1. Converting to fractional coordinates
    2. Wrapping coordinates to [0, 1) range
    3. Converting back to cartesian coordinates
    
    Parameters:
        sites (list): List of pymatgen Site objects representing atomic positions
        lattice (Lattice, optional): Lattice object for periodic boundary conditions.
                                   If None, treats coordinates as non-periodic.
        
    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Cartesian coordinates of the centroid
    
    Example:
        >>> sites = [site1, site2, site3]  # List of pymatgen Site objects
        >>> centroid = calculate_centroid(sites, structure.lattice)
    """

def cluster_summary_stat(compounds_with_clusters, entries):
    """
    Generate a comprehensive summary of cluster statistics and analysis results.
    
    This function creates a detailed report that includes:
    - Total number of compounds analyzed
    - Number and percentage of compounds containing clusters
    - Detailed information for each compound:
        * Material ID and formula
        * Total magnetization
        * Number of clusters
        * For each cluster:
            - Size (number of atoms)
            - Average interatomic distance
            - Detailed site information
    
    The compounds are sorted by number of clusters in descending order
    for easier analysis of the most interesting cases.
    
    Parameters:
        compounds_with_clusters (list): List of compound dictionaries, each containing:
            - material_id (str): Unique identifier for the compound
            - formula (str): Chemical formula
            - total_magnetization (float): Total magnetic moment
            - clusters (list): List of cluster dictionaries
        entries (list): List of all analyzed entries (for statistics)
        
    Returns:
        str: A formatted multi-line string containing the analysis summary
        
    Raises:
        TypeError: If input parameters are None or not lists
        KeyError: If compound dictionaries are missing required fields
            (material_id, formula, total_magnetization, clusters)
    
    Example:
        >>> compounds = [{"material_id": "mp-123", "formula": "Fe2O3", ...}]
        >>> entries = [entry1, entry2, entry3]
        >>> summary = cluster_summary_stat(compounds, entries)

        -------------------------
        Total Compounds Analyzed: 3
        Compounds with Clusters: 1 (33.3%)
        ...
    
    Notes:
        - The function assumes that cluster dictionaries contain 'sites',
          'size', and 'average_distance' keys
        - Empty or missing clusters lists are handled gracefully
        - The summary includes blank lines between compounds for readability
